👋🏻 Hello, I'm Joy Barot (Exonymos)

I'm a dedicated web developer, open-source enthusiast, and tech explorer based in Gujarat, India. My journey in tech is fueled by a passion for crafting modern, responsive web applications and learning new technologies.

I'm a self-taught developer with a background in Computer Engineering. I have some experience working with various technologies, including JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I'm always eager to learn new things and expand my skill set.

Feel free to browse my portfolio, explore my projects, or reach out if you'd like to connect. Thanks for stopping by!
