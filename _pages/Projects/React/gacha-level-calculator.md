## Reach Your Next Level in Gacha Games with Ease

Leveling up in gacha games can sometimes be a daunting task, especially when you're trying to figure out how much experience is needed to reach your target level or how many days it might take based on your daily grind. That's where the Gacha Level Calculator comes in—a simple yet powerful tool built with Next.js that helps you plan your game progression with confidence.

## What It Does

The Gacha Level Calculator allows you to:

- Calculate Required EXP: Enter your current level, current exp, and target level to see how much exp you need.
- Estimate Time to Level Up: Provide your daily exp gain (optional) to see how many days it may take to reach your desired level.
- Currently, the calculator supports popular gacha games such as Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Wuthering Waves, and Zenless Zone Zero, with the possibility of more games being added in the future.

## User-Friendly Design

The homepage of the website features a beautiful list of available games, each represented by their game image as the background. This design not only makes navigation intuitive but also visually engaging, inviting you to select the game you're playing and quickly get the data you need.

## Built with Next.js

The project is built using Next.js, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience. This modern framework helps in creating a seamless interface that handles calculations efficiently and displays results in real time.
